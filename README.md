# Siam May – The Next-Gen Martial Arts Club Management Platform

> **Status:** ⚠️ **Actively under heavy development – expect rapid iteration & breaking changes.**
>
> I'm polishing this project in public as part of my portfolio: the codebase evolves daily as I experiment with the latest patterns in Next.js, TypeScript, and modern UI/UX. ⭐ **Star** the repo and follow the journey!

---

## ✨ Why it exists
Running a combat-sports academy is more than taking attendance – it's about **community, scheduling, payments & growth at scale**.  Existing "all-in-one" solutions feel dated, slow, or locked behind paywalls.  _Siam May_ is my answer: a fully-serverless, open-source platform that brings the seamless user experience of modern SaaS to martial-arts gyms.

**Key goals**
1. **Delight the end-user** – lightning-fast class booking, crystal-clear schedules, mobile-first UX.
2. **Empower staff & owners** – rich admin tools, real-time analytics, automated billing & notifications.
3. **Showcase engineering craft** – strong typing, scalable architecture, defensive programming, DX that sparks joy.

## 🏆 Feature highlights (implemented & planned)
- **Real-time Class Scheduling** – instant updates powered by Supabase subscriptions.
- **One-click Enrolment / Unenrolment** with optimistic UI & rate-limited endpoints to prevent abuse.
- **Secure Auth** – Magic Link, OAuth, and RBAC (`member`, `staff`, `admin` roles) baked-in.
- **Automated Payments** – background cron workers reconcile payment status & reset expired classes.
- **Admin Dashboard** – filter / search classes, see live capacity, and manage enrolments visually.
- **Mobile-Perfect UX** – Tailwind v4 + Radix UI primitives + Headless animations ensure pixel-perfect responsiveness.
- **Blazing Performance** – React 19 server components, HTTP caching, and on-demand ISR keep TTFB low.
- **Type Safety Everywhere** – shared Zod schemas & Supabase generated types reduce runtime bugs.
- **Defence-in-Depth** – edge-ready rate-limiting, centralized error handling, secure tokens.
- **Dark Mode** (because recruiters notice 😉).

> **Coming soon**
> – Attendance analytics (PR in progress) • In-app notifications • Stripe integration • Progressive Web App • i18n (EN/ES).

*Stateless frontends talk to typed endpoints; server actions cache & revalidate via standardised tags (`classes`, `users`, `payments`).*

## 🚀 Quick start (local)
```bash
pnpm install     # fast dependency install
pnpm dev         # next dev on http://localhost:3000
```
1. Create a `.env.local` with your Supabase keys:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
   CRON_SECRET=your-super-secret-cron-token
   ```
2. Run **Reset Logic** test script to seed mock data:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:reset:dev
   ```
3. Test cron jobs locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:cron:all
   ```
4. Log in with the magic link provided in the terminal and explore!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues After Domain Changes

**1. User Registration 500 Error**
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Update Site URL and Redirect URLs with your new domain
- Verify environment variables in Vercel Dashboard

**2. Cron Job Failures**
- Update GitHub Secrets: `VERCEL_URL` and `CRON_SECRET`
- Test locally: `pnpm test:cron reset-classes`
- Check Vercel Function Logs for detailed errors

**3. Authentication Callback Issues**
- Ensure redirect URLs are configured in Supabase
- Check that callback URL matches your domain
